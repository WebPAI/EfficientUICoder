Try to remember it by reading it once! Nope? Your visitors will also have a hard time remembering it, so the possibility of them returning to your page is close to zero.<br/>
You don't want to move your page to another place (another server for example) or you just don't have this as an option. Here comes our site to help you.<br/>
We offer you a short memorable name for your site. Choose the name you like, enter the real address of your site and that's it.<br/>
Visitors enter http://urlku.info/<your> and goes straight to your page.<br/>
There is one more advantage of choosing such a name. After all you decided to move to a new place, and then again ... and maybe again. So how are you going to tell all your visitors that you moved?<br/>
For these cases, you choose your short name and just update the address of your site. No matter where it is, your visitors will always find you.<br/>
WARNING!!!  If your address does not have any requests for 60 days, it will be deleted. </your></p><p><a>bookmarklet</a></p></div><div id="footer"><p><a>Are link shorteners safe?</a>
